## Interactive Game for People with PTSD

**"Walking through shadows to reclaim the light."**

### Vision and Purpose

DreamWalker is an interactive, therapeutic game built with **Unreal Engine 5** designed to provide a safe, controlled environment for processing difficult emotions and experiences associated with **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**.

The game uses immersive storytelling and metaphor-rich environments to guide the player through symbolic "dreamscapes," offering tools and mechanics focused on:

* **Emotional Regulation:** Mechanics that help ground the player in the present moment.
* **Narrative Reclaim:** Opportunities to re-contextualize difficult memories within a fantasy setting.
* **Positive Coping:** Encouraging gentle exploration and achieving personal milestones.

### Key Features

* **Custom Unreal Engine Mechanics:** Unique Blueprint and C++ logic tailored for emotional feedback.
* **Symbolic Dreamscapes:** Hand-crafted environments designed for non-linear exploration.
* **MIT Licensed Code:** All custom game code and Blueprints are open for review and contribution.
